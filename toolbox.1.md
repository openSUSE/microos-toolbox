# NAME

**toolbox** - script to start a toolbox container for system debugging

# SYNOPSIS

**toolbox** [[-h/--help] | [list|create [\<name\>]|enter [\<name\>]|run|stop [\<name\>]] [-r/--root] [-u/--user] [-n/--nostop] [-S/--sandbox] [-P/--no-pull] [[-R/--reg \<registry\>] [-I/--img \<image\>]|[-i/--image \<image_URI\>]] [-X/--runtime \<runtime_bin\>] [[-t/--tag \<tag\>]|[-c/--container \<name\>]] [command_to_run]]

# DESCRIPTION

On systems using `transactional-update` it is not really possible - due to the read-only root filesystem - to install tools to analyze problems in the currently running system as a reboot is always required. This makes it next to impossible to debug such problems.
`toolbox` is a small script that launches a podman container in a rootless or rootfull state to bring in debugging or admin tools.

The root filesystem can be found at `/media/root`. In a "user toolbox" (i.e., one started with `toolbox -u`) the user's home directory is available in the usual place (`/home/$USER`).

The following options are available in `toolbox`:

* `-h` or `--help`: Shows the help message
* `-u` or `--user`: Run as the current user inside the container
* `-n` or `--nostop`: Do not stop container on exit, allowing multiple sessions to the same toolbox
* `-R` or `--reg` `<registry>`: Explicitly specify the registry to use
* `-I` or `--img` `<image>`: Explicitly specify the image to pull
* `-i` or `--image` `<image>`: Full URI of the image to pull (alternative to `-R` & `-I`)
* `-r` or `--root`: Runs podman via sudo as root
* `-t` or `--tag` `<tag>`: Add `<tag>` to the toolbox name
* `-c` or `--container` `<name>`: Fully replace the toolbox name with `<name>` (alternative to `-t`)
* `--podman-args` `<args>`: Pass addition args to podman command

The following variables can be overridden by setting them in `${HOME}/.toolboxrc`:

* `REGISTRY`: The registry to pull from. Default value is: `registry.opensuse.org`.
* `IMAGE`: The image and tag from the registry to pull. Default value is: `opensuse/toolbox`.
* `TOOLBOX_NAME`: The name to use for the local container. Default value is: `toolbox-${USER}`.
* `TOOLBOX_SHELL`: Standard shell if no other commands are given. Default value is: `/bin/bash`.

Example `.toolboxrc` file:
```
REGISTRY=my.special.registry.example.com
IMAGE=debug:latest
TOOLBOX_NAME=special-debug-container
TOOLBOX_SHELL=/bin/bash
```

If a config file is found, with `REGISTRY` and `IMAGE` defined, `${REGISTRY}/${IMAGE}` is used, overriding the default.
If `-R` and/or `-I` (or `-i`) is/are used they override both the defaults and
the content of `REGISTRY` and/or `IMAGE` from the config file. If an alternate
image is used, the `REGISTRY` and/or `IMAGE` needs to be specified with every
`toolbox` call.

# CONFIGURATION FILES

Beside the user configuration file, there are two additional system wide
configuration files:

* `/usr/share/toolbox/toolboxrc`: distribution specific configuration file
* `/etc/toolboxrc`: system specific configuration file created by a system administrator

The configuration files are read in the order: `/usr/share/toolbox/toolboxrc`,
`/etc/toolboxrc`, `~/.toolboxrc`. The last value is used.

# ALTERNATIVE COMMANDS

It is possible to interact with `toolbox` using a command based interface such as:

* `create`: Creates a toolbox, but does not "enter" inside of it
* `enter`: Enter a toolbox (creating it, if it does not exist, in our case)
* `run`: Run a command / start a program inside a toolbox
* `list`: Show existing toolboxes, although for now it is basically an alias to `podman ps -a`

This commands imply user mode (-u) and uses a different container (`toolbox-<user>-user` vs. `toolbox-<user>`).

# ROOTLESS

By default a toolbox is a rootless container. This means that being root inside the toolbox itself does not map with being root on the host,
e.g., as far as file permissions, access to special files, etc go.

## Rootless Usage Example

```
$ id
uid=1000(dario) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),496(wheel),1000(dario)
$ toolbox
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-dario' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-dario')
toolbox-dario
Container started.
Entering container. To exit, type 'exit'.
...
toolbox-dario:/ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
toolbox-dario:/ # ls -alF /media/root
total 88
drwxr-xr-x   1 65534 65534   256 Sep 12 10:33 ./
drwxr-xr-x   3 root  root     48 Jan 20 14:06 ../
drwxr-xr-x   1 65534 65534  1674 Dec 17 02:17 bin/
drwxr-xr-x   1 65534 65534   554 Jan 18 10:44 boot/
drwxr-xr-x  22 65534 65534  4300 Jan 19 22:22 dev/
...
toolbox-dario:/ # tcpdump -i em1
tcpdump: em1: You don't have permission to capture on that device
(socket: Operation not permitted)
...
toolbox-dario:/ # touch /media/root/etc/foo
touch: cannot touch '/media/root/etc/foo': Permission denied
```

## Rootless Usage Example, With User Setup

In case a proper user environment is what one wants (e.g., for development), the `-u` (or `--user`) option can be used:

```
$ id -a
uid=1000(dario) gid=1000(dario) groups=1000(dario),...
$ toolbox -u
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-dario-user' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-dario-user')
toolbox-dario-user
Container started.
Entering container. To exit, type 'exit'.
dario@toolbox-dario-user:~\> id
uid=1000(dario) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
...
dario@toolbox-dario-user:~\> echo $HOME
/home/dario
dario@toolbox-dario-user:~\> ls -l /home
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 dario users 2290 Jan 20 14:33 dario
```

The user will have (paswordless) `sudo` access so, e.g., packages can be installed, etc:

```
$ ./toolbox -u
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-dario-user' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-dario-user')
toolbox-dario-user
Container started.
Entering container. To exit, type 'exit'.

# ROOTFUL

In fact, toolbox called by a normal user will start the toolbox container but the root filesystem of the host cannot be modified, special devices cannot be accessed, etc.
Running toolbox with sudo has the disadvantage, that the `.toolboxrc` in the `root` user home directory, and not the user's, is used.
To run the toolbox container with root rights, `toolbox --root` (or `-r`) has to be used.

## Rootfull Usage Example

```

uid=1000(dario) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),496(wheel),1000(dario)

# ADVANCED USAGE

## Running a command/program inside a toolbox

By default, toolbox drops the user into a shell, inside the container. It is possible, instead, to launch a specific command or program inside of the container:

```
$ toolbox -u sudo zypper in figlet
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-dario-user' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-dario-user')
toolbox-dario-user
Container started.
Entering container. To exit, type 'exit'.
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following NEW package is going to be installed:
  figlet

1 new package to install.

| __/ _ \ / _ \| | '_ \ / _ \ \/ / |
| || (_) | (_) | | |_) | (_) \>  \<|_|
 \__\___/ \___/|_|_.__/ \___/_/\_(_)
```

Of course, the command to run could even be a shell. However, for using a different shell than the default one inside of the toolbox, it is also possible to change the value of the `TOOLBOX_SHELL` variable within the config file.

## CUSTOM IMAGE

toolbox uses an openSUSE-based userspace environment called `opensuse/toolbox` by default, but this can be changed to any container image. Simply override environment variables in `$HOME/.toolboxrc`:

```
# cat ~/.toolboxrc
REGISTRY=registry.opensuse.org
IMAGE=opensuse/toolbox:latest
```

Alternatively, either the `-R` and `-I` parameters can be used, like this:
```
$ toolbox -u -R registry.opensuse.org -I opensuse/tumbleweed:latest
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Spawning a container 'toolbox-dario-user' with image 'registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/tumbleweed:latest'

(NOTE that, if 'sudo' and related packages are not present in the image already,
this may take some time. But this will only happen now that the toolbox is being created)
Container created.
Entering container. To exit, type 'exit'.
dario@toolbox-dario-user:~\> exit
...
dario@toolbox-dario-user:~\>
exit
dario@Wayrath:~/Documents/Work/Dario/SUSE\> podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                             COMMAND     CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS   NAMES
b9b79fda84f1  registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/tumbleweed:latest  sleep +Inf  About a minute ago  Exited (143) 3 seconds ago          toolbox-dario-user
```

Or just put the full URI under the `-i` parameter, such as `toolbox -u -i registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/tumbleweed:latest`.

## Multiple Toolboxes

It is possible to want to create multiple toolboxes, especially user ones. For instance, one may want to create a special user toolbox, inside which doing development of virtualization related projects. This is possible by adding a tag to a toolbox name, via the `toolbox --tag <tag>` option:

```
$ podman ps --all
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                                             COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS  NAMES

```

## Alternative (Command Based) UI

When using the command-based interface, the following basic operations are carried out:

* Creating a user toolbox and entering inside it (equivalent of `toolbox -u`):
```
toolbox create
toolbox enter
```
* Running a command inside a toolbox (equivalent of `toolbox -u /usr/bin/foo`):
```
toolbox run ls /home/
```
* Creating (and entering) a toolbox tagged as `devel` (equivalent of `toolbox -u -t devel`):
```
toolbox create -t devel
toolbox enter -t devel
```
* Creating (and entering) a toolbox called `tbx-apps` (equivalent of `toolbox -u -c tbx-apps`):
```
toolbox create -c tbx-apps
toolbox enter -c tbx-apps
```

Option `-r` can be used together with commands as well, like this:
* Creating a toolbox running as root, with your user inside (equivalent of `toolbox -u -r`):
```
toolbox create -r
toolbox enter -r
```
* Running a command inside a toolbox that runs as root on the host and has your
user configured in it (equivalent of `toolbox -u -r /usr/bin/foo`):
```
toolbox create -r
toolbox run -r ls /home/
```

Note that the latter working mode has no equivalent in containers/toolbox, where if a toolbox running as root user on the host must be started with `sudo`.

## Automatically enter toolbox on login

Set an `/etc/passwd` entry for one of the users to `/usr/bin/toolbox`:

```
useradd bob -m -s /usr/bin/toolbox
```

Now when SSHing into the system as that user, toolbox will automatically be started:

```
# ssh bob@hostname.example.com
Last login: Thu Oct  3 16:52:16 2019 from 192.168.107.1
.toolboxrc file detected, overriding defaults...
Container 'toolbox-bob' already exists. Trying to start...
(To remove the container and start with a fresh toolbox, run: podman rm 'toolbox-bob')
toolbox-bob
Container started successfully. To exit, type 'exit'.
toolbox-bob:/ #
```

# TROUBLESHOOTING

## Podman can't pull/run images with user

If you want to run `toolbox` without root privileges, you may need to add a range of UID and GID for the user.  If `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` are empty or do not exist, these commands can be used:

```
echo "podman_user:100000:65536" > /etc/subuid
echo "podman_user:100000:65536" > /etc/subgid
```

## GUI application can't connect to display

This happens if the user runs the container as root - with sudo for example - while logged in as user to the desktop environment. The easiest way is to use `toolbox -u` to setup a "rootless toolbox"  container for such cases.
